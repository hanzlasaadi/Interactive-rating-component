## Overview

- It is a simple card that has radio buttons with which a user can give feedbaack which appears on a new card after clicking submit

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Select and submit a number rating
- See the "Thank you" card state after submitting a rating

## My process

- First I created the main layout with the header(svg) => rounded corners
- Then my most time was taken up by radio buttons and displaying labels inside it
- At the end, I added button with rounded border and styled it.
- With JavaScript, I did 2 things with an event handler function to the button:
  - I hid the previous card with the help of "hidden" class.
  - Then, I used the radio button value to display in the second card.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Vanilla](http://vanilla-js.com/) - JS library
- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) - For styles

### What I learned

I honed my skills with git and github. I wrote my own JavaScript code which felt more than great. I also leared that I should also opt for back-end development cause I suck at front-

**I love this layout (I can add/remove as many classes as I want)**

```html
<div class="thanks hidden">
  <span class="thanks hidden">
    <img src="images/illustration-thank-you.svg" alt="thanks" />
  </span>
</div>
```

**I know these are simple selectors but love them cause' how I used them.**

```css
.hidden {
  display: none;
}

.center {
  display: flex;
  justify-content: center;
}
```

**Completely wrote the code myself, proud of myselfðŸ˜Š**

```js
button.addEventListener("click", function () {
  first.forEach((el) => {
    el.classList.add("hidden");
  });
  thanks.forEach((el) => {
    el.classList.remove("hidden");
    el.classList.add("center");
  });

  radioButtons.forEach((el) => {
    if (el.checked) {
      bigDot.textContent = `You selected ${el.value} out of 5`;
    }
  });
});
```

### Continued development

- I really want to learn more about jquery on how it uses radio buttons cause' that is one of weak points.
